  With the improvement of the economy and living standards, transportation
  has seen a rise to its demand. This has been felt in the railway industry of high-speed
  trains where they have constantly continued to improve and meet 
  demands. High speed trains not only provide fast and reliable journey through
  a country but connects economic hubs, boosting the economy. Not only is it 
  key to boosting economic growth, it also eco-friendly with low carbon
  emissions and more energy efficient which in turn has received wide praise  
  and become a staple mode of travel in countries such as China and Japan. This 
  influence has also been felt in Europe where a survey carried out by CER
  revealed that “3 in 4 EU citizens would take a high-speed train instead of a
  plane when travelling across Europe for short and medium distances” [1]. To
  meet demand, high-speed trains continuously operate at high speeds well
  above 200km/h. The weight of a high-speed train can cause line loss, 
  energy consumption, and cause load on the brake system [2]. They are the 
  one of the biggest achievements in the train industry. It provides a fast and 
  reliable method of transportation for long distance travel between cities. Its 
  efficiency not only extends to this point but also encompasses sustainability in 
  transportation. This article focuses on the applications of lightweight materials 
  Magnesium and Aluminium alloys, in the design of high-speed trains.

  Aluminium Alloy Characteristics and Applications
  Through the creation of high-speed trains, aluminium alloys have been the preferred material as their unique
  properties incorporated seamlessly to the special operating conditions of this trains.
  
  The advantages of aluminium that highlighted its importance in the engineering of high-speed trains were:
•	Weight of the train could be greatly reduced while meeting safety requirements such as rigidity and strength. 
  Comparing it to steel, which is used in train manufacturing, aluminium alloy is 30%-50% lighter. 
  Therefore, increasing the proportion of aluminium alloy used in the production of high-speed train body parts would make it lighter.
•	Good corrosion resistance which can be enhanced by chemical methods such as spraying or coating its surface.
•	“Excellent thermal conductivity and better heat dissipation” [3] than steel. This avoids hot spots during localized heating.
  Table 1 compares the the thermal conductivity of an aluminium alloy and 2 types of steel (carbon and stainless steel) used
  in the production of high-speed trains.

Aluminium alloy is mainly used in to manufacture all parts of a high-speed train such as the roof, the underframe and its walls. 
  This demonstrates the various applications where aluminium is required due to its lightweight characteristics.

Although aluminium comes with a high cost for train manufacturers and operators, its advantages
such as greater transport capacity, reduction in energy consumption and lower maintenance costs
makes it more cost effective than steel in the long run.

Magnesium Alloy Characteristics and Applications
Magnesium alloys are a more recent material implemented in the manufacturing of high-speed trains. 
This material has many advantages such as:

•	Lightweight, which is important in the manufacturing of high-speed train body parts.
•	Good rigidity and impact resistance which meets the safety requirements of the operating environment of high-speed trains.
•	It has non-toxic characteristics which demonstrates it safe use in transportation.
•	Its high electric conduction reduces energy loss in electrical systems in the train being more energy efficient.

However, one of magnesium alloy most prominent characteristic is its specific strength which compared to its counterparts
used in the manufacturing of high-speed trains, aluminium alloy and steel, is higher. Therefore, “the weight of an aluminium
or iron component can be reduced without reducing the strength of the component” [4]. Figure 2 shows a comparison of the specific
strength of magnesium alloy compared to other materials.[5]

Magnesium alloys are used in production of various parts of a high-speed train. Although this itself is at its
early stages of implementation many more components will be replaced with magnesium alloy-based ones as they are more efficient for the operations of the train.

To summarise, “when the same strength and rigidity are ensured, the weight of the magnesium alloy body is 32.8% lower than that of the aluminium alloy car body. 
If the weight of the single-section aluminium alloy car body is 10 tons; the weight of the single section magnesium alloy car body is 6.72 tons” [6].
The reduction in the weight provides an energy saving efficiency to the motor of the train, where when the train is running at 200km per hour,”
the energy consumption per unit mileage can be reduced by 9.16%” [7]. This reduces operating costs longer journeys can be completed with less fuel.

Conclusion
In conclusion, lightweight materials such as aluminium and magnesium alloys are essential when designing and producing a high-speed train.
This cannot be ignored as it benefits both the environmental safety and the industry’s demands. Both aluminium and magnesium alloys prove to
be cost effective in the long run as their implementation reduces energy consumption and carbon emissions. It also reduces the weight of
a high-speed train, making it safer and allowing it to maintain high speeds throughout its journeys.
